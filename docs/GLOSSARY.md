## Beaker Finance Glossary

### Deploy
As the deployer of a Beaker, you get to decide which transactions will be executed if the Beaker reaches its fundraising goal and there are no constraints on what transactions a Beaker is allowed to execute.

For example, you can deploy a Beaker that provides liquidity to a DeFi protocol, sweeps an NFT floor, buys a basket of tokens, or virtually anything else you can think of.

### Contribute
If you are interested in owning a fraction of the assets a Beaker will hold you can be a contributor. Contributors provide funds to a Beaker so it will reach its fundraising goal! 

### Finalize
Once a Beaker has reached its fundraising goal anyone is allowed to finalize the Beaker. Finalizing a Beaker executes the transactions that were specified by the deployer of the Beaker using the funds provided by the contributors. Finalization only needs to be done once.

### Claim Tokens
Once a Beaker has been finalized contributors can claim an allocation of Beaker LP (BLP) tokens proportional to their contribution. BLP tokens represent fractions of the assets held by the Beaker contract.

### Claim Refund
If a Beaker does not reach its fundraising goal before the end of its fundraising period, contributors can withdraw their contributed funds.

### Submit Block Trade
A block trade is an offer to purchase BLP tokens directly from BLP token holders for a given price. Anyone may submit a block trade and the block trade with the highest value is always offered to BLP token holders. The price of a block is how much the trader believes all outstanding BLP tokens for a given Beaker are worth.

For example, if a trader wants to purchase 5 AVAX worth of BLP tokens for a Beaker that holds 10 AVAX worth of assets, the trader should submit a block trade of approximately 10 AVAX and withdraw the block trade once they have been able to purchase 5 AVAX worth of BLP tokens.

### Withdraw Block Trade
A trader that has submitted a block trade may withdraw their offer at any time. Withdrawing a block trade sends any unused AVAX back to the trader. Withdrawing a block trade is useful when a trader has acquired their desired amount of BLP tokens or when a trader's block trade offer is no longer the highest block trade offer

### Accept Block Trade
Accepting a block trade means selling your BLP tokens to the trader that submitted the block trade offer. BLP token holders can choose to sell some, or all, of their BLP tokens when accepting a block trade. The amount received when accepting a block trade is the amount of BLP tokens being sold multiplied by the block trade price divided by the total supply of BLP tokens.

For example, say you hold 1 BLP token, there is a total supply of 16 BLP tokens for the Beaker, and the current block trade offer is 11 AVAX. If you accept the block trade and sell your 1 BLP token you would receive 0.6875 AVAX (1 * 11 / 16).

### Set Buyout Price
BLP token holders can vote on a buyout price for the Beaker. The buyout price is the price required to purchase all of the assets held by the Beaker.

### Submit Buyout
Anyone can submit a buyout to become the owner of a Beaker. The owner of a Beaker can do whatever they want with the assets held by the Beaker.

### Accept Buyout
Accepting a buyout allows BLP token holders to claim their share of a buyout.

### Acquire Ownership
Anyone that holds all of the BLP tokens for a given Beaker may make themselves the owner of the Beaker by acquiring ownership. The owner of a Beaker can do whatever they want with the assets held by the Beaker.
